# **Air Canvas - Hand Gesture Drawing Application**

## **Overview**

**Air Canvas** is a Python-based application that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Leveraging the power of **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for image processing, this app provides an intuitive interface for gesture-based drawing.

## **Features**

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand landmarks and recognizes pinch gestures to enable drawing.
- **Real-time Drawing**: Draw lines on a virtual canvas using hand movements.
- **Webcam Feed Integration**: Displays the webcam feed alongside the virtual canvas for seamless interaction.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Deploy the app easily online with a user-friendly interface.

## **How It Works**

1. **Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in real-time.
2. **Gesture Detection**: Identifies specific gestures (like pinch) to start drawing.
3. **Drawing on Canvas**: Draws lines on the canvas as you move your hand while pinching.
4. **Web Integration**: Streamlit provides a simple way to run the app in a web environment.

## **Installation**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository:**
